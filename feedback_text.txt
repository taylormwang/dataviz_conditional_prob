Haha wasn't prepared to math today ><
I really like the Kahoot activity and how Xinxin and Susan explained everything!
This class is very interesting!
I relied heavily on my previous probability coursework to follow the class and answer questions. 
Thank you. It's a wonderful experience. 
Good!
Great!!!
